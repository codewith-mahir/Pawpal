cd animal-rescue-adoption-platform
```

# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd client && npm start
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build for production

## Browser Recommendations for macOS

1. **Safari** - Native macOS browser, excellent performance
2. **Chrome** - Full feature support, great for development
3. **Firefox** - Good alternative with privacy features
4. **Edge** - Microsoft browser, works well on macOS

## File Path Differences

### Windows vs macOS Paths
- Windows: `e:\Project\animal-rescue-adoption-platform`
- macOS: `/Users/[username]/Projects/animal-rescue-adoption-platform`

### Environment Variables (.env file)
- Same configuration works on both systems
- No changes needed in .env file

## Deployment Options for macOS Users

### 1. Local Development
- Run on `http://localhost:3000` (frontend)
- Backend on `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Cloud Deployment
- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku
- Access from any device with internet

## Troubleshooting on macOS

### Permission Issues
```bash
# If you encounter permission errors
sudo npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Port Conflicts
```bash
# If port 3000 or 5000 is busy
lsof -ti:3000
kill -9 [PID]
```

### Node Version Management
```bash
# Install nvm for Node version management
brew install nvm

# Use specific Node version
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

## Performance Tips for MacBook

1. **Use Terminal**: Native terminal performs better than third-party apps
2. **Enable Developer Mode**: For faster builds and debugging
